/* 
00.json was create manually from by overlaying
maps of Northern Ireland's Travel to Work Time Areas (TTWAs)
and UK Parliamentary Constituencies.
Constituencies were assigned to TTWAs using human judgment
to approximate the TTWA they shared the most land area with.
When a constituency's land area fell nearly equally within
two or more TTWAs, it was assigned to TTWA with the larger
population in it's principle city and or the largest 
number of constituencies already assigned to it.
