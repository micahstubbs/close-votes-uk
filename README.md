An iteration on Jan Willem Tulp's [Close Votes](http://tulpinteractive.com/projects/close-votes/) project, this time showing the results of the May 2015 UK Parliamentary Elections.

This iteration is a step towards a reusable chart I hope to generalize from this [d3js](http://d3js.org/) project.

See Jan Willem's original code at this [block](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/c248e13bf367f56baf84) and this [gist](https://gist.github.com/micahstubbs/c248e13bf367f56baf84). 

Data from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2015/results) as [scraped by](https://github.com/kjhealy/uk-elections) the resourceful [`@kjhealy`](https://github.com/kjhealy)
